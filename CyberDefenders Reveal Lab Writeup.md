# CyberDefenders Reveal Lab Writeup

## Overview
This repository documents my approach to solving the **CyberDefenders Reveal Lab**, a blue team challenge focused on analyzing a Windows memory dump (`192-Reveal.dmp`) to reconstruct a multi-stage malware attack. The lab covers malicious process identification, command-line analysis, and network activity correlation, aligning with my certifications: CompTIA Security+, CySA+, CASP+, and GIAC GFACT, GSEC, GCIH. Answers are redacted (e.g., `[REDACTED]`) to respect the challengeâ€™s integrity for GitHub sharing.

- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Memory forensics with Volatility 3
  - Malware process and payload analysis
  - Command-line argument extraction
  - Network forensics and threat intelligence
- **Tools Used**:
  - Volatility 3: Memory dump analysis (`windows.cmdline`, `windows.malfind`)
  - Strings: Artifact extraction from dumped processes
- **Environment**:
  - Memory dump: `192-Reveal.dmp` (Windows, likely 10 x64)
  - Malicious process: `[REDACTED].exe` (PID `[REDACTED]`)
  - Working directory: `~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir`

## Methodology

### Q2: Malicious Process Name
- **Objective**: Identify the process executing malicious activity.
- **Technique**: Filtered process hierarchy with `windows.pstree` and checked for injected code using `windows.malfind`.
  ```bash
  vol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.pstree > pstree_output.txt
  vol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.malfind > malfind_output.txt

Identified process with unusual parent or RWX regions in memory.
Skills: Memory forensics (CySA+, GCIH), process analysis (GSEC).

Q3: Parent PID of Malicious Process

Objective: Determine the parent PID of the malicious process.
Technique: Used windows.pslist to list processes and their PIDs.
bashvol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.pslist > pslist_output.txt

Located PID [REDACTED] and noted its parent PID.


Skills: Process enumeration (Security+, GFACT).

Q4: Second-Stage Payload File Name

Objective: Identify the file name of the second-stage payload (format [REDACTED].dll, not smss.exe).
Technique: Extracted command-line arguments with windows.cmdline and verified files with windows.filescan.
bashvol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.cmdline > cmdline_output.txt
vol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.filescan | grep ".dll" > filescan_output.txt

Checked PID [REDACTED] for arguments invoking a DLL (e.g., rundll32.exe C:\Temp/[REDACTED].dll,EntryPoint). Confirmed DLL in filescan_output.txt.


Skills: Malware analysis (GCIH), file system forensics (CySA+).
Wireshark Correlation: Filtered for DLL downloads (if PCAP available):
wiresharktcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443 && http.request.method == GET && http.request.uri contains ".dll"
tcp.port == 445 && smb.file contains ".dll"


Q5: Shared Directory on Remote Server

Objective: Identify the remote SMB share name.
Technique: Enumerated network connections with windows.netscan.
bashvol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.netscan > netscan_output.txt

Identified SMB connections (port 445) for PID [REDACTED] or related processes, noting share names like \\192.168.x.x\[REDACTED].


Skills: Network forensics (CySA+, GCIH).
Wireshark Correlation: Filtered for SMB traffic:
wiresharktcp.port == 445 && smb2


Q6: MITRE ATT&CK Sub-Technique ID

Objective: Identify the sub-technique for DLL execution via a Windows utility (format T1218.011, not T1059.001).
Technique: Analyzed command-line arguments with windows.cmdline and checked for injected code with windows.malfind.
bashvol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.cmdline > cmdline_output.txt
vol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.malfind > malfind_output.txt

Checked PID [REDACTED] or child processes for utilities like rundll32.exe executing [REDACTED].dll.


Skills: Threat mapping (GCIH), malware analysis (CySA+).
Wireshark Correlation: Filtered for payload downloads:
wiresharktcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443 && http


Q7: Username of Malicious Process

Objective: Identify the user account running the malicious process.
Technique: Mapped PIDs to SIDs with windows.getsids.
bashvol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.getsids > getsids_output.txt

Matched PID [REDACTED] to its username via SID.


Skills: User account analysis (Security+, GFACT).
Wireshark Correlation: Filtered for authentication:
wiresharksmb || kerberos


Q8: Malware Family

Objective: Identify the malware family.
Technique: Analyzed injected code with windows.malfind and extracted artifacts with windows.procdump.
bashvol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.malfind > malfind_output.txt
vol -f ~/Downloads/lab/temp_extract_dir/192-Reveal.dmp windows.procdump --pid [REDACTED] --dump-dir dump/
strings dump/[REDACTED].exe > strings.txt

Checked malfind_output.txt for injected code and strings.txt for C2 domains or signatures.


Skills: Malware identification (GCIH), artifact extraction (CySA+).
Wireshark Correlation: Filtered for C2 traffic:
wiresharkudp.port == 53 || http


Key Findings

Vulnerability: Malicious process leveraged a Windows utility to execute a DLL payload.
Attack Flow: Initial execution via [REDACTED].exe, DLL payload delivery, potential SMB-based lateral movement, and C2 communication.
Impact: Unauthorized code execution and potential network compromise.
